/**
 * XSerialize would need to define...
 *      + types for every built in XSD type
 *      + types for complexType and simpleType including restrictions
 * Further, every type would need to exist in the base document because there would be no way of defining which objects
 * were isolatable.
 *
 * It really might be in your best interest and the best interest of 3rd party users of this library to define
 * a new type of XML document that encompasses the definition of any standard object.
